        <h2 class="Questions">First Off: Who Is John?</h2>
          <p class="answers">Born in New York, John Gallagher has spent his life loving sports, politics, and technology. As a child, he decided that he'd do all he could to become a big
          sports radio host. So he set out to get a job in radio, knowing that the odds were against him succeeding. </p>
          <p class="answers">However he never gave up.</p>
          <p class="answers">After a few years of trying, one day he received a call for an interview in Lexington, KY, from a station which was looking for an overnight weekend producer for one of Clear Channel's
          AM stations. The interview went well, and John got the job!</p>
          <p class="answers">Over time, John received promotion after promotion, and eventually was made the lead producer for all University of Kentucky athletics, and a reporter for the Cincinnati Reds. He had partially
          realized his dreams, and he couldn't have been happier!</p>

        <h2 class="Questions">That's Great!</h2>
          <p class="answers">Yes, it was! However the pay - and the hours - were horrendous. John was working 70+ hours a week but earning $29k a year. He was traveling to every major city in the US, however he could never
          enjoy it since he knew he was leaving his girlfriend alone, and he never had any free time.</p>
        <h2 class="Questions">So...What Happened?</h2>
          <p class="answers">After a few years on the job, Clear Channel asked John to pay for his travel but to still cover the teams. Frustrated, John tendered his resignation, and set out to find work in one of his
          favorite cities: Denver. He was accepted into both DU and CU-Boulder, and started off studying Mechanical Engineering.</p>
        <h2 class="Questions">Wow! That's cool!</h2>
          <p class="answers">Yea! However there was one problem: John hated college. He felt stupid paying for classes for which he had no interest, and none of the classes excited him. He felt like a fool.</p>
        <h2 class="Questions">Oh No! What Did He Do?</h2>
          <p class="answers">To be honest, he did nothing for a while. Well...he did work, however it wasn't the type of work he felt was fulfilling or meaningful, let alone challenging. Then one day, while driving
          for Lyft, he met a man who worked in the Galvanize campus on Platte Street. The man told him all about the programs Galvanize offers, and how their immersive programs, while challenging,
          offered a way for John to find a new career in a field he had always loved, but only did as a hobby. All he had to do was get in.</p>

        <h2 class="Questions">Did He Get In?</h2>
          <p class="answers">Not originally. He failed the entrance interview, so he signed up for the Workshop. Not only did he learn a lot in the program, but it confirmed his desire to work in coding!</p>
